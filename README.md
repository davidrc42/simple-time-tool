Welcome to SST, simple time tool.

INSTALL INTRUCTIONS
Linux:
-use the package manager of your distribution, for this example I will use pacman 

sudo pacman -S git python3 python-pip
pip install pygame playsound
git clone https://github.com/davidrc42/simple-time-tool
sudo chmod +x  /<path-to-where-you-cloned>/simple-time-tool/src/main.py

GETTING STARTED
the configuration file can be found at .../simple-time-tool/src/config.py
making simple time tool easy to use and reliable:
1.make keyboard shortcut for starting STT directly from you window manager or run prompt
it should be enough to just use the path to /simple-time-tool/src/main.py to launch STT, because you made it an executable at installation
2.make keyboard shortcut for opening the configuration file in your prefered text editor
